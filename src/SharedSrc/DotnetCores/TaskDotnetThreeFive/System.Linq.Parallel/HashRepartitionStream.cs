/// A repartitioning stream must take input data that has already been partitioned and
/// redistribute its contents based on a new partitioning algorithm. This is accomplished
/// by making each partition p responsible for redistributing its input data to the
/// correct destination partition. Some input elements may remain in p, but many will now
/// belong to a different partition and will need to move. This requires a great deal of
/// synchronization, but allows threads to repartition data incrementally and in parallel.
/// Each partition will "pull" data on-demand instead of partitions "pushing" data, which
/// allows us to reduce some amount of synchronization overhead.
///
/// We currently only offer one form of reparitioning via hashing.  This used to be an
/// abstract base class, but we have eliminated that to get rid of some virtual calls on
/// hot code paths.  Uses a key selection algorithm with mod'ding to determine destination.
///
/// @TODO: @BUG#519: consider adding a bound to the buffers. Unfortunately this can quite easily
///     lead to deadlock when multiple repartitions are involved. Need a solution.
/// @TODO: @BUG#504: consider amortizing synchronization overhead by enqueueing/dequeueing in chunks
///     rather than single elements. Also need to be careful not to introduce deadlock.
