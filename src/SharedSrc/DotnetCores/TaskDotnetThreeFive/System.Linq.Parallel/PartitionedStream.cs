/// <summary>
/// A partitioned stream just partitions some data source using an extensible 
/// partitioning algorithm and exposes a set of N enumerators that are consumed by
/// their ordinal index [0..N). It is used to build up a set of streaming computations.
/// At instantiation time, the actual data source to be partitioned is supplied; and
/// then the caller will layer on top additional enumerators to represent phases in the
/// computation. Eventually, a merge can then schedule enumeration of all of the
/// individual partitions in parallel by obtaining references to the individual
/// partition streams.
///
/// This type has a set of subclasses which implement different partitioning algorithms,
/// allowing us to easily plug in different partitioning techniques as needed. The type
/// supports wrapping IEnumerables and IEnumerators alike, with some preference for the
/// former as many partitioning algorithms are more intelligent for certain data types.
