/// Spin locks can be used for leaf-level locks where the object allocation implied by using a <see cref="T:System.Threading.Monitor" />, in size or due to garbage collection pressure, is overly
/// expensive. Avoiding blocking is another reason that a spin lock can be useful, however if you expect
/// any significant amount of blocking, you are probably best not using spin locks due to excessive
/// spinning. Spinning can be beneficial when locks are fine grained and large in number (for example, a
/// lock per node in a linked list) as well as when lock hold times are always extremely short. In
/// general, while holding a spin lock, one should avoid blocking, calling anything that itself may
/// block, holding more than one spin lock at once, making dynamically dispatched calls (interface and
/// virtuals), making statically dispatched calls into any code one doesn't own, or allocating memory.
/// </para>

/// application's performance. It's also important to note that <see cref="T:System.Threading.SpinLock" /> is a value type,
/// for performance reasons. As such, one must be very careful not to accidentally copy a SpinLock
/// instance, as the two instances (the original and the copy) would then be completely independent of
